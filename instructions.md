How to use this app
===================

This app was created as part of the John's Hopkin's Data Science specialization 
on Coursera, for the Data Products course.  Read the respective headings for
instructions on how to create the charts on each tab.  An effort was made to
have player names and year selections carry over between tabs for consistency of
user experience.
