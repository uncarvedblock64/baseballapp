# About

This app was created as part of the John's Hopkin's Data Science specialization 
on Coursera, for the Data Products course.  The data used was freely available
via R data packages.  This app does not offer any guarantee to the accuracy of
the calculations performed, and is used for entertainment only.  

To simplify the data, players who never had > 400 At bats in any season were
eleminated for the dataset, and historical leagues other than the current
National League (NL) and American League (AL) were not included, but are
available as part of the Lahman baseball data packages.
